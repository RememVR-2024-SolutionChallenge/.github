## **Project Intro**

RememVR is a service facilitating participation in reminiscence therapy based on VR contents for dementia patients. Our team implemented video-to-VR technology based on AI models, utilizing GPU, which proves to be significantly more cost-effective than other equipment commonly employed in the creation of existing VR content.

## **Problem Statement**

#### **Main Target**

Dementia patients and caregivers are the main target of our challenge.

#### **Problem Context**

According to WHO, there are over 55 million people worldwide living with dementia in 2020 and they project this number will almost double every 20 years. Aged society and increasing amount of people with dementia implies that care technology should back up the status quo. Reminiscence therapy is one of the effective therapy for people diagnosed with dementia, enhanced with VR contents. However, creating VR content with realistic models of objects and people involves a costly process that includes 3D scanning and real-time rendering. A recent Korean documentary 'Meeting You' has shown similar VR experience with our service. The total project costed about $100,000 and the cost only for the VR contents was half of the total production cost.

#### **Main Problem**

RememVR is designed to mitigate the expensive process involved in creating VR content for reminiscence therapy.

## **UN Sustainable Development Goal & Targets**

![SDGs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RememVR-2024-SolutionChallenge/.github/main/profile/assets/sdgs.png)
We chose UN Sustainable Development Goal 3, specifically with target 3.8 and 3.d. As dementia is a disease that influences whole community which includes individuals and their family, our service could provide essential health care services. Simultaneously, providing VR contents based on reminiscence therapy would strengthen the capacity for risk reduction and management of dementia.
